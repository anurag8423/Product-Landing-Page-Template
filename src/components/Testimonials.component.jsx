        feedback: "CpoyGen is a fantastic tool for writing product descriptions and getting started on blog posts. No longer do I have to stare at a blank screen trying to figure out how to flesh out a topic beyond 50 words. For me, CopyGen replaces buying PLR content that I would similarly edit and personalize. This saves me time because I can actually tailor to my keyword and niche needs.",
