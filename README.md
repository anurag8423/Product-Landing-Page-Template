# Product Landing Page Template

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anurag8423/Product-Landing-Page-Template.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production:**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Preview the production build:**
   ```sh
   npm run serve
   ```

This setup includes:

- **React** for building user interfaces
- **Vite** for fast development and build
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first CSS styling
- **ESLint** for maintaining code quality
